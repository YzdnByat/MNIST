# MNIST Neural Network Classification

This repository implements and trains deep learning models for handwritten digit classification on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) using **PyTorch**.  
It was developed as part of my self-learning in neural networks and model evaluation.

---

## Results
- Implemented a fully connected neural network (Model_V1) with BatchNorm and Dropout regularization.  
- Achieved **~97% accuracy** on the MNIST test set.  
- Visualized training/validation loss and accuracy curves.  

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing with normalization and dataset visualization.  
- Custom **train/validation split** from the training data.  
- Training loop with **Adam optimizer** and **cross-entropy loss**.  
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics and learning curves.  
- Jupyter Notebook (`MNIST_Neural_Network.ipynb`) containing the full pipeline.
